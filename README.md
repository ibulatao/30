# 30

-- This repo is a practice repo for me to hone my coding skills starting from zero.

Day 0 - 5.25.2025
Created this private repository named "30" signifying the 30 day plan to start from the beginning and be at a higher level within 30 days of 2-3 hours of learning coding everyday.

Initial projects:
"Hello, world" in HTML and Python.

Created index.html and hello.py
