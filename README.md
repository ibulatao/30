## This readme file documents my road from 0 to 30 days and how far I'll go by coding 4 hours a day and learning from multiple sources.

## Day 1 - 5.25.2025

- Created the repository and looked up GitHub CLIs and learned the basics of push and pull requests.
- Created the following files:
  'index.html': Shows a basic greeting, "Hello, World!"
  'hello.py': Prints out, "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

- Key learnings: Usage of Git CLI, How to push changes to GitHub

## Day 2 - 5.26.2025
